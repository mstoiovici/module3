PhoneBook Project -Defining a software project

We need to create an online phone book platform which will be used by users to find businesses and individuals. They might search using different filters.

Must have:
- a database with 3 tables (one for all businesses, one for individuals/people and one for location - which will retrieve the coordinates for all postcodes from the other two tables)
- businesses table  will have the following columns/filters:busyness type, business name, postcode, addresses, telephone number
- people table will have the following columns/filters: first name, surname, postcode, addresses, telephone numbers
- a search on businesses type or businesses name
- a search on individuals surname
- a search on location
- result of the search would be in alphabetical order 

Could have:
- ask the user for the filter on businesses, so the result might be retrieved using any of the filters from the database
- ask the user for the filter on individuals/people, so the result might be retrieved using any of the filters from the database
- a search on individuals by first name
- in the search bar under the location input form there should be an option to refine the search by location radius 

Would have:
- ads for gifts when users are searching for individuals
- location targeted ads
- location targeted front-end background e.g. highland cows if the user looks for businesses in Scotland
- a search history
